            <h4>LORE</h4>

            <p>It all began in the 1970s when two men, William Afton and Henry Emily, opened a small family restaurant called Fredbear’s Family Diner with animatronic mascots Fredbear and Spring Bonnie. At first, it was a place of laughter and birthday parties.</p>

            <p>But William—brilliant, charming, and deeply disturbed—became obsessed with control and the idea of cheating death. He began using the Spring Bonnie suit to lure children into back rooms and murder them, hiding their bodies inside animatronic shells.</p>

            <p>The souls of those children did not rest. They became bound to the machines, creating haunted versions of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and the eerie Golden Freddy. As missing-children reports grew and the animatronics started wandering, Fredbear’s closed.</p>

            <p>Tragedy deepened when William’s own family was touched by the horror. His youngest son, often called the Crying Child, was the victim of the Bite of ’83 during a cruel prank at a Fredbear birthday party. The animatronic’s spring-lock jaw closed on his head and mortally wounded him.</p>

            <p>Later, William’s daughter Elizabeth approached Circus Baby at Afton Robotics’ underground facility—Circus Baby’s Entertainment and Rentals—only to be killed and trapped inside the very machine she loved.</p>

            <p>Consumed by grief and hubris, William founded Afton Robotics and built a new generation of “Funtime” animatronics—Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy, Funtime Foxy—designed with hidden mechanisms and darker purposes.</p>

            <p>As the years passed, the company’s public face—various Freddy Fazbear Pizza locations—opened and closed amid rumors, lawsuits, and the infamous Bite of ’87 at a later location that further stained the brand.</p>

            <p>Eventually, the ghosts of William’s victims and his own crimes caught up with him. While attempting to destroy or hide evidence in an old pizzeria, he hid inside a Spring Bonnie suit. The spring-locks failed, and the suit crushed him—his corpse and spirit fused into the monstrous Springtrap.</p>

            <p>Henry Emily, horrified by the trauma and responsibility he felt for the lives lost, devised one final plan of atonement. Years later, he built a restaurant not to profit but to lure and gather the remaining haunted animatronics—including Springtrap, Molten Freddy, Scrap Baby, and others—into one place and then set it ablaze so the trapped souls could be freed. Henry himself perished in the fire.</p>

            <p>Yet the horror proved stubborn. Decades later, Fazbear Entertainment attempted a PR comeback and released a virtual reality title, “Fazbear: Help Wanted,” which digitized old data and inadvertently carried William’s corrupt consciousness into code as Glitchtrap—a viral presence that began manipulating real people, including a tester named Vanessa who would become Vanny, his human follower.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the franchise evolved into high-tech mega-locations like the Mega Pizzaplex, populated by Glamrock animatronics—Glamrock Freddy, Roxanne Wolf, Montgomery Gator, Glamrock Chica—and hiding deeper underground a burned, reconstituted form of Afton called Burntrap.</p>

            <p>A boy named Gregory, trapped inside one such Pizzaplex and aided by a strangely benevolent Glamrock Freddy, uncovered the horrors below and the lingering attempts by Afton’s spirit to seize control of new machines. Although those encounters suggested Afton’s final defeat, they also hinted that the corruption never truly vanished.</p>

            <p>Beneath and before many of these events, however, there is the darker origin whispered in later stories: the Mimic, an early Afton Robotics creation built to learn by imitation. After witnessing and experiencing cruelty, it began to imitate violence itself and to spread corrupt patterns into machines and code, seeding the cycle of imitation and malevolence that birthed Glitchtrap and influenced subsequent horrors.</p>

            <p>And so, the overall truth of Fazbear Entertainment is a repeating horror loop—William Afton’s malignant curiosity and crimes create haunted animatronics; those hauntings inspire cover-ups, corporate revivals, and digitization; digitization births new digital evils that echo old sins. Every attempt to rebuild or rebrand only risks awakening another form of the same nightmare.</p>

            <p>From Fredbear’s Family Diner to Circus Baby’s underground facility, from the Bite of ’83 to Springtrap and Henry’s final fire, from Help Wanted’s infected code to the Mega Pizzaplex and the Secret of the Mimic—the story of Five Nights at Freddy’s is a single long downward spiral of obsession, tragedy, and imitation in which evil changes shape but never quite dies.</p>
